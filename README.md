# CNC-Camera
## Objective
CNC Camera is a simple Mac program to facilitate marking the zero point for a CNC Mill like cnc14.de. It presents a window displaying the feed of a camara attached to the mill, overlaid with a crosshair.
## Technical
CNC Camera requires Mac OSX 11.x or higher and is a 'universal app' for older Macs with Intel processors as well as recent machines with an Apple M processor. The program is available as a standard Mac (DMG) Installer, double click and 'go'. The buttons at the bottom of the screen will look slightly different on older versions of OSX but functionality is always the same.
## How to use
You should first connect your CNC Mill USB-camera to your Mac and then start CNC Camera. Theoretically you can connect multiple cameras although this is of little use.

**Select Camera:** The app will display the built-in camera of your Mac at startup. Use 'Select Camera' to cycle through all cameras until you find the CNC Mill camera.

**Mirroring:** A webcam will normally not be mirrored, i.e., the image moves to the left when you move the mill to the right and vice versa. This is confusing and switching on 'Mirroring' will reverse the movement and provide a natural feel.

**Magnification:** You can switch magnification to 1x, 2x or 3x.

**Crosshair:** You can select the line width of the crosshair as well as the color for maximum contrast with the color of your milling material.
